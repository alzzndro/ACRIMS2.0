# Capstone Research - Asian College Room and Instructor Monitoring System

This project is our final output in years of taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

# Description

This project is for our School's Room and Instructor Monitoring System.
Currently, the school utilizes a paper-based monitoring and manually inputting it through a spreadsheet.
This method makes it more inefficient and more prone to errors, whether human-errors or digital-errors.

Our web-app solve that problem by digitalizing the form and making a centralized dashboard that an admin can oversee.

This is website fully responsive.
